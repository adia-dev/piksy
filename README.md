# Piksy

> ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**<br>
> Piksy is an evolving C++ application for effortless **sprite sheet editing**, **frame extraction**, and **animation handling**. It's currently **replacing** [this project](https://github.com/adia-dev/spritesheet_editor) but remains under heavy development!

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Sprite Sheet Organization**  
  Load and preview your sprite sheets, neatly organize files, and quickly navigate through folders.

- **Frame Extraction**  
  Automatically detect frames with computer vision (or create them manually for full control).

- **Animation Editing**  
  Combine frames into animations, reorder them on-the-fly, and preview motion instantly.

- **Color Swapping**  
  Tap into a handy color tool to replace any target hue with a new color, saving manual editing time.

- **Export & Save**  
  Save all animations as JSON and export textures as PNG. Perfect for engine-ready assets!

> **Tip**<br>
> Piksy is great for game devs, hobbyists, and artists needing a streamlined workflow to handle sprite sheets.

1. **Load or Drop a Sprite Sheet**
   - Use the "File" menu or simply drag-and-drop your sprite sheet into Piksy.
2. **Extract Frames**
   - Choose the "Extract" tool, draw a selection, and Piksy detects frames in that region.
3. **Create & Preview Animations**
   - Group these frames into sequences. Adjust timing and naming on-the-fly.
4. **Export**
   - Save the entire texture or export your animation data to JSON with a quick menu option.
